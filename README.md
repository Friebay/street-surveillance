## Goals
- Determine if there are people at the pedestrian crossing.
- Detect cars approaching the pedestrian crossing.
- Count the number of cars in the parking lot.
- Count the number of people who have crossed the pedestrian crossing.

## Data Collection
- Photographs were captured from a live camera feed at 12-minute intervals.
- A total of 876 images were collected over 10 days.

## Annotation of Photos
- Each image was annotated for two object classes: cars and people.

## Limitations
- Supports only a single camera.
- Performance degrades in poor weather conditions.

## Practical Applications
- Enhanced pedestrian safety at crosswalks with poor visibility.
- Integration with autonomous vehicles for improved traffic assessment.
- Parking availability insights via a mobile app.
